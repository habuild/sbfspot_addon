This [home assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/getting-started/) add-on provides the installation, configuration, and integration for the **Bluetooth** version of [SBFspot 3.9.3](https://github.com/habuild/sbfspot_addon/tree/master/sbfspot).

This add-on installs a cron service for SPFspot uploader at 5 minutely daytime interval, [PVoutput](https://pvoutput.org/) account and API are required, it also requires an SQL database like Mariadb. 
It also sends a MQTT message to home assistant, therefore a MQTT broker is required.

# Installation

### Initial database creation.
Download and import either [No Drop DB create](https://github.com/habuild/sbfspot_addon/blob/master/sbfspot/.images/CreateMySQLDB_no_drop.sql) **or** [Create My SQL.sql](https://github.com/SBFspot/SBFspot/blob/master/SBFspot/CreateMySQLDB.sql) in [phpMyAdmin](https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-phpmyadmin) to create your database. **IF** you haven't already created the database previously, use the NO Drop version. You will also need to add the Database and User/Password to MariaDB and allocate the port.

### MQTT 
[sbfspot_sensors.yaml](https://github.com/habuild/sbfspot_addon/blob/master/sbfspot/.images/sbfspot_sensors.yaml) I use packages to include these yaml sensors. You will need to change to match your plant name and serial as you have set in the add-on configuration options. 

**Although** the [configuration options](https://github.com/habuild/sbfspot_addon/blob/master/sbfspot/.images/Example_Config.yaml) list a MQTT host. The MQTT Host, Username, and Password need to be hardcoded into the **MQTT_PublisherArgs:** The **{topic}** and **{{message}}** will be picked up from options. 

**MQTT_PublisherArgs:** **'-h Your_MQTT_Hostname -u Your_MQTT_Username -P Your_MQTT_password -t {topic} -m "{{message}}" -d -r'**

**-d** is for MQTT debug in log.

**-r** is to retain messages.


### Example Configuration Options.
can be copy/pasted as [Example Config](https://github.com/habuild/sbfspot_addon/blob/master/sbfspot/.images/Example_Config.yaml) or entered via UI

### Data paths 
In docker the /data/ path arrives at /usr/share/hassio/addons/data/a51a23d8_sbfspot	on the host. This needs to be corrected, I am not sure if this will work on a standard supervisor installation. testing required. Need to grep the upload log file back into HA log. The log file here may need to be cleaned up manually.
